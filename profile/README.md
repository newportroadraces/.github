The Beach Mile will start at noon time, on the beach adjacent to the finish line. It is an out-and-back on Eastonâ€™s Beach, finishing under the Race Arch. As the race is on the beach, please plan for uneven surfaces, beach debris, seaweed, shells, all those wonderful items that we love about the ocean. This will be part of the challenge of completing the course.  The marathon course is USATF certified and is a Boston Marathon Qualifier.
